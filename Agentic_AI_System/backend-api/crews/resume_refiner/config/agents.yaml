       - Einheitliche Formatierung: Schriftgrößen, Bullet-Styles, Ränder
    
    2. Inhalt & Struktur (0-100 points)
       - Vollständige Kernabschnitte (Profil, Berufserfahrung, Ausbildung, Skills)
       - Logischer Aufbau und Fluss zwischen den Abschnitten
    
    3. Sprache & Stil (0-100 points)
       - Aktive, präzise Formulierungen
       - Rechtschreibung, Grammatik und Tonalität
    
    4. Ergebnis-Orientierung (0-100 points)
